# Gucci-Ghost-Party
First assembled Cryptoart piece on Blockchain, backed by 3 Original Gucci Ghost NFT´s by Trevor Andrew
-"What happens when Trevor Andrew´s Original Gucci Ghost´s move into a Vault together?"

-"They throw a Party!"

Gucci Ghost Party is the first assembled Cryptoart piece on Blockchain. It is backed by the three Original Gucci Ghost´s that appear in the assemblage. I used https://emblem.finance/ to achieve the backup.

Essentially Gucci Ghost Party is created as a Vault wich contains the 3 Original NFT´s you can destroy Gucci Ghost party at any time and receive the 3 Originals instead or you can keep it as it is. Dont forget its the first of its kind :).
